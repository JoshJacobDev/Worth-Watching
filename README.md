# Worth-Watching

Why spend an hour and a half watching a movie you had no real interest in? 

Worth Watching was designed to help users find a great movie! 
Users have the ability to look up movie ratings using OMDB's API. 
Trailers related to the search will also be displayed to help the 
user make their final movie decision. The Youtube Data API helps 
makes this possible.
